- release built jar(s) in repo
- publish to maven central
- include hints for graalvm native image building in jar
- see if there is a generator for a good mock server
    - kotlin-server seems to contain only a server stub which is not very suitable for unit-testing. It also requires some effort to build (especially using older gradle versions)
    - kotlin-spring seems to contain only a server stub which is not very suitable for unit-testing. Building wasn't straightforward, and I quit the effort for now.
    - kotlin-vertx might be more than a server stub (don't understand vertex well enough to judge from a glance). Building was not straightforward and the generated code contained errors.
- add other language clients
